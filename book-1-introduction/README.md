Up until now, you didn't have the power to destroy your machine, but within the first two weeks of attending Nashville Software School you will have that power. Go buy a backup drive RIGHT NOW and start backing up your entire hard drive.

**Seriously, right now!**

## For OSX Users Only

### Xcode Command Line Tools

Since you are going to be learning how to be a professional software developer, you will be using your computer terminal heavily. OSX users need to install some baseline tools to use more advanced things later in the course.

Type this command into your terminal, and then wait a while.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### Command Line Launcher

Set up VS Code to be [launched from the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).

### Homebrew

Visit the [homebrew home page](http://brew.sh/) and follow the single instruction there to get it installed.

### Oh My Zsh

1. If you haven't install Homebrew from the previous step, please complete that first.
1. Install zsh which is a powerful replacement for the standard bash terminal by typing the following command into the terminal
    ```
    brew install zsh zsh-completions
    ```
1. Install [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) which is a framework for Z shell which makes the terminal a pleasure to work in. Use the following command.
    ```
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```


### Create SSH key

SSH is a technology that allows you to create a very secure connection between your computer, and a computer located somewhere else in the world. It's an acronym for Secure SHell. When you create an SSH key on your computer, it actually creates two files

1. A public key file that you share with other people and computers. It is usually named `id_rsa.pub`.
1. A private key file that you never, ever, ever, ever, ever share with anyone. It is usually named `id_rsa`.

Follow the [Github instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-mac) for creating a new SSH key, and providing your public key to Github, so that you can establish a secure connection between your computer and Github's computers.
