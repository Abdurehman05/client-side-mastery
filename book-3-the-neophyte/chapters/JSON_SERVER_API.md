# API: The Next Level of Peristent Storage

Up to this point, you've been using local storage to persist data. However, local storage is usually used to store very small chinks of data about a user of your website to make their experience better.

1. User preferences
1. Items in their shopping cart
1. Deals the signed up for
1. Notification settings

In this chapter, you are going to use a tool called `json-server` to store your application's data in JSON format on your file system instead of on the browser.

Visit the Github [repo for json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) if you want to learn more details.

## Setup

### Install JSON Server

```sh
npm install -g json-server
```

### Create the API

You are going to create an API that you will use to store and retrieve information your favorite foods.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/javascript/exercises/food-api/api
cd $_
touch database.json
```

Next, pre-populate your API with some of your favorite foods. Each object should have the following keys.

1. Name (_string_)
1. Type (_string_)
1. Ethnicity (_string_)
1. Side dishes (_array_)

> Example data in `database.json`

```json
{
    "food": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Linguine with bolognese",
        "type": "pasta",
        "ethnicity": "italian"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Massaman curry",
        "type": "curry",
        "ethnicity": "thai"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Green curry",
        "type": "curry",
        "ethnicity": "thai"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Ravioli Funghi",
        "type": "pasta",
        "ethnicity": "italian"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Tuscan Rustica",
        "type": "vegetarian",
        "ethnicity": "italian"
    }
    ]
}
```

Now that the routes are configured and you have some data, you can start your API with the following command.

**_Make sure you are in the `api` directory of your project._**

```sh
json-server -p 8088 -w database.json
```

Go to Chrome and go to the following URL.

[http://localhost:8088/food](http://localhost:8088/food)

You will see a JSON representation of all of your favorite foods.

## Filtering Data

Now filter the food to only show Italian dishes

[http://localhost:8088/food?ethnicity=italian](http://localhost:8088/food?ethnicity=italian)

Or curry dishes.

[http://localhost:8088/food?type=curry](http://localhost:8088/food?type=curry)

## Using Postman for API Queries

Postman is a valuable tool for software developers who want to explore any API resources. When you are building your own API for a group project, or when you are building one for a personal project or your capstone, Postman will help you test the API before you starting writing your application code.

1. Visit the [Postman apps page](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) and download the application for your OS.
1. Watch the wonderful [Postman Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C) series on YouTube.

## Practice

Practice using Postman to perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations on your new food API.

1. GET all curry dishes. Use the [filter feature](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#filter).
1. Use POST to create some of your favorite foods.
1. Perform a GET operation using the [`q` URL parameter](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#full-text-search) to find any entries that have the pattern of `ol` in them.
1. [Sort](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#sort) the foods by ethnicity.
