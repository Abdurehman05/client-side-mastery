# React Component State and Props

## State

State is simply the current values of the properties used to render a component. Your brain will try to make it more complex than that, so remember this statement.

> State is simply the current values of the properties used to render a component.

React components respond to changes in state. Any detected change in any value will cause the component to be rendered again. A fancy phrase for this is [_state transition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram).

`State A -> Event -> State B`

That event could be myriad things.

1. The user filled out a form and clicked the submit button
1. The user moved an element on the DOM
1. The user clicked a checkbox
1. An XHR completed and acquired new data from an API
1. The user pressed enter in an input field
1. The user selected an option in a dropdown

etc...

The method you will use to initiate the state transition is `setState()`. You initialize state by defining `this.state` in the component's constructor. Let's take a look.

```js
class Rachel extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        /*
            This is needed to properly initialize a React
            component if you define a constructor
        */
        super(props)

        // Set the initial state of the component
        this.state = {
            firstName: "Rachel",
            lastName: "Morgan"
        }
    }

    render () {
        return (
            <article>
                <h2>{this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}</h2>
            </article>
        )
    }
}
```

Now the `render()` method is using the current state of the component to render the value of the `h2` element. Now to change the state of the component. By adding a button and responding to the click event, the `setState()` method can be used to trigger a render cycle on the component.

```js
class Rachel extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        /*
            This is needed to properly initialize a React
            component if you define a constructor
        */
        super(props)

        // Set the initial state of the component
        this.state = {
            firstName: "Rachel",
            lastName: "Morgan"
        }
    }

    convertToUpperCase = (event) {
        /*
            Create a new object that holds the upper cased
            version of your name
        */
        const upperCased = {
            firstName: this.state.firstName.toUpperCase(),
            lastName: this.state.lastName.toUpperCase()
        }

        /*
            Initiate the state transition - which invokes render()
        */
        this.setState(upperCased)

    }.bind(this) // Necessary evil to bind the component to the event

    render () {
        return (
            <article>
                <h2>{this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}</h2>
                <button onClick={this.convertToUpperCase}>
                    Change to Uppercase
                </button>
            </article>
        )
    }
}
```

## Props

Passing state values from one component to another is a fundamental part of React. You are used to passing values around as function arguments.

```js
const bio = (firstName, lastName, occupation, info) => {
    return `
        ${firstName} ${lastName}

        Currently working as a ${occupation}

        ${info}
    `
}

const hannahBio = bio("Hannah", "Hall", "Software Engineer", "Graduated NSS in cohort 13. Junior instructor as NSS for one year. Now kicking ass professionally.")
```

Since React is all components written as JSX, which itself is mimic of HTML, we pass values as element attributes.

> Bio.js

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'


/*
    Bio itself has no state since the Hannah component
    will be sending it all the data it needs as props
*/
class Bio extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Occupation: {this.props.occupation}</p>
                <p>Bio: {this.props.bio}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }
}


export default Bio
```

> Hannah.js

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import Bio from "./Bio"


class Hannah extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        /*
            This is needed to properly initialize a React
            component if you define a constructor
        */
        super(props)

        // Set the initial state of the component
        this.state = {
            firstName: "Hannah",
            lastName: "Hall",
            occupation: "Software Engineer",
            bio: "Graduated NSS in cohort 13. Junior instructor as NSS for one year. Now kicking ass professionally."
        }
    }

    // Occupation and bio now sent to Bio as properties
    render() {
        return (
            <article>
                <h2>{this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}</h2>
                <Bio occupation={this.state.occupation} bio={this.state.bio} />
                </button>
            </article>
        )
    }
}

export default Hannah
```


## Practice

You're going to update your application that represents you to use state and props. Previously, you hard-coded the following information into your components.

1. Your full name
1. Your cohort
1. Your home address
1. The make and model of your favorite vehicle
1. The name, and species/breed of your favorite, or ideal, pet

Now you need to pull all of that data that is scattered across your component files, and give your personal component an initial state with appropriate properties.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import Home from "./Home"  // Import the Home component


class Me extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        super(props)

        // Put all information about yourself as state properties
        this.state = {
            firstName: "Rachel",
            lastName: "Morgan"
        }
    }

    // Update your JSX to use state properties
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h3>{this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}</h3>
                <h4>Evening Cohort 1</h4>
                <h5>Nashville Software School</h5>
                <Home />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Me
```

Now, pass the state values from your personal component to each of its children, and use those props in the children components.
