## Introduction

> While you are still getting settled at your new desk and Brady finally figured out how to get into your laptop, you walk over to your captain's door and rap your knuckles on it confidently.
>
> Silence...
>
> "Captain?" you ask with your face right in front of the door.
>
> More silence...
>
> _"I guess I'll try later..."_ you think to yourself, and wander back to your desk.
>
> Just as you sit down and type in your password to log into your laptop, you hear loud footsteps coming down the hallway next to the elevators on the other side of the room. Muffled voices are intermingled in with the strangely loud footsteps. Seconds later, a man and a woman turn the corner of the hallway, each with a drink and a snack in their hands, talking animatedly with each other.
>
> You watch, curious who they are.
>
> The woman catches your eye and says something to the man and extends her hand for a perfunctory handshake. She then turns to you and heads straight for your desk.
>
> You shift in your seat, and then decide to stand up to greet this person who is confidently striding towards you.
>
> "Well, well, well," she says with a bright voice and a wide smile. "This must be our newest detective - the transfer from Chicago!"
>
> "Um, yes, my very first day." You introduce yourself and extend your hand, just as she did for the man a few moments ago.
>
> "So nice to meet you. I'm Captain Debrowski. Margaret Debrowski, but everyone just calls me Maggie." She shakes your hand enthusiastically.
>
> Captain Debrowski... Maggie... sits down in the aluminum chair with the awful green padding on the other side of your desk. You sit back down along with her. She grabs the case file and turns it towards her for a brief review.
>
> "Ah, yes, the extortion mystery." Her brows furrow as she looks at Carl's photo, and she says solemnly, "I just can't imagine who would do something like this to Carl and the other shop owners downtown. There isn't a single soul in this town who doesn't know Carl, or one of his boys."
>
> She turns the file back around and looks up at you. "It just about ruined him," she says with a dark look on her face.
>
> "Did all of the shop owners have insurance?" you ask.
>
> "All but one. Nellie Freemon ran her antique and oddities store, but never had the sense to get additional, commercial crime insurance. Of course, her business was only extorted once." She lowers her voice and says gently, "She never did have much revenue, so I guess it just wasn't worth their time to extort what she couldn't make."
>
> That sounded like good knowledge, so you reach quickly for the pen on your desk, click it open and scribble a note in your notepad.
>
> Maggies smiles blandly. "Oh, it's all there in the file." She waves at the folder.
