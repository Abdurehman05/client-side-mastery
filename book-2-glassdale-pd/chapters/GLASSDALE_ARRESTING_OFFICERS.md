# Show Who Was Arrested by Whom

For this feature, you will be doing nearly the exact same thing you did when you filtered the displayed criminals by crime. Except in this case, you will build a component that renders a `<select>` element that is populated with all officers in the Glassdale, IL police department.

When the user selects an officer, show the criminals that were arrested by that officer.
