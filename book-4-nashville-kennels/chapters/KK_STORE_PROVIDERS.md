# Display Products at a Store

If you haven't yet, create a **`LocationDetails`** component that displays the details of an individual location for the Kandy Korner franchise. This component should render in a modal when the user clicks on a single location.

When the modal renders, it should list all of the products that are sold at that location. You can do an unordered list or just separate the products with commas.
