# Rendering the Data

Now that you have determine which properties are needed to render the information that Debra needs, it's time for you to start creating the components that will render HTML representations to the DOM.

* You will need a list component
* You will need a photo component that renders the image, the probe name, the Earth date it was taken, and the name of the camera used to take the picture.
* Make sure you render the components in `main.js` after the data has been initialized.
