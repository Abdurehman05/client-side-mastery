# Bludgeons &amp; Flagons

## The Making of the Most Popular Tavern Game of the Middle Ages

![](./images/tattered-flagon.jpeg)

In the roaring 1130's, peasants and serfs across Europe and Western Asia popularized a tavern game known as Bludgeons & Flagons. Scholars believe that the game originated in the Tattered Flagon tavern located in Southern Aragon, near the city of Jara.

Since it was not an official game of the royalty or merchant classes at the time, writings about it are rare and often vague. However, what modern anthropologists have been able to piece together paint a picture of an odd, fun, and sometimes violent game - depending on how drunk the contestants became.

The rules of the game were fairly simple, yet allowed for some subtlety.

1. There were three teams in a game of Bludgeons & Flagons.
    * The Knights
    * The Fairies
    * The Goblins
1. Each team had three players.
1. Five flagons of ale, mead, or wine would be arranged on a table. Four flagons making the corners of a square, and the fifth being placed in the middle of the square. The table should be in an area of a tavern where the teams had some ability to move around.




## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives of this project, by the end of the client side course, are the following.

* Using `fetch` to retrieve data from 3rd-party providers
* Event listeners
* Understanding asynchronous programming
* Collecting user input and acting on it
* Modular CSS
* Modular JavaScript
* Identifying and building components


Given those feature requests, what you need to do in this chapter is the following tasks.

1. Visit https://api.nasa.gov/ and get yourself an API key so you can access their data.
1. Identify the components that need to be rendered in this application.
1. Identify the structure and relationship of the components _(e.g. a Photo component is rendered as a child of the MarsDay component, etc...)_
1. Decide on a layout for your Daily Mars application. Draw a simple wireframe that shows where each component will be rendered.
1. Come see a member of the instruction team to review your component layout.
1. After discussing your layout, you can then create a new project directory of `~/workspace/eyes-on-the-sky`, and start building the HTML and CSS of your components and layout.

> **Reminder:** Remember to create a CSS file for each component, and use the `@import` statement in `main.css` to include each one. Also consider what sub-directories you will need under the `scripts` directory, if any. Discuss with your instructor.
