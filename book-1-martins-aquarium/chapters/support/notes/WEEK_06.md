# Week 6 Notes

## Day 1

o Holiday Road all day

* Told everyone that today was the last day of the project since most teams were already working on stretch goals.
* After lunch, I create the retro boards on all their repos and around 14:30, told them to start creating notes for their retro.

## Day 2

o Retros start at 9:10

o Second retros started around 9:45

o Class demos at 10:30

o Modular JavaScript Self-Assessment at 13:05

o Reviewed assessment questions at 15:30

* Since everyone had done an amazing job on their project, especially how much thought they put into customizing it for their chosen persona, I decided to have class demos so they all see what each team did.
* After demos, gave them the rest of morning for lab time. Was just over an hour for reflection and decompression.
* After lunch, told team that I was giving them a self-assessment and really emphasized that this was for them to assess their own level of understanding of the syntax and concepts so far.
* My plan was to assign the Clinic assessment to anyone who didn't perform well on the questions about fundamentals so I could see, in further detail, where they were weak. No one performed poorly, which was encouraging.
